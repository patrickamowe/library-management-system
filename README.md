# library-management-system
A full-featured Library Management System built to streamline library operations. It enables efficient management of books, members, borrowing records, and other library activities.


# 📚 Library Management System

A Python-based **Library Management System** that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
The project allows you to manage library items (books, magazines, DVDs), members, and borrowing activities, with automated tests written using the **unittest** framework.

## 🧩 System Architecture & Class Relationships

Below is a high-level description of the relationships between the core classes:

### **1. LibraryItem (Base Class)**

* Represents a generic item in the library (e.g., title, author, publication year).
* Acts as a parent class for all item types.

### **2. Derived Classes**

* **Book**, **Magazine**, and **DVD** inherit from `LibraryItem`.
* Each subclass adds its own unique attributes, such as:

  * `Book`: ISBN
  * `Magazine`: Issue number
  * `DVD`: Duration

### **3. Member**

* Represents a library member with attributes like name and ID.
* Keeps track of items borrowed and their due dates.
* Can borrow or return items via the `Library` class.

### **4. Library**

* Acts as the system controller.
* Maintains collections of `LibraryItem` and `Member` objects.
* Handles borrowing and returning logic.
* Calculates fines using item due dates and return dates.
